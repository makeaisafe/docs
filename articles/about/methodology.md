# Our methodology

We describe the methodology we use to review and publish technical solutions that mitigate AI risks.

## Related Works

There are several existing works that continously collate and evaluate AI benchmarks, standards, and how to mitigate certain risks. We hope that this will allow us to bridge the AI risks identified by policy makers and the technical solutions that can be implemented to mitigate risks posed by AI.

## Crowdsourcing Technical AI Risk Mitigation Solutions
We accept submissions of technical solutions that mitigate AI risks. These solutions can be in the form of code, algorithms, or technical documentation. We will review the submissions and publish them on this website.

[Submission Form](https://airtable.com/appBTXyj9B623uKpQ/pagpo4p7zYYObzPZo/form)

Submissions will create a pull request on our GitHub repository. We will review the pull request and merge it if it meets our criteria.
