## Discrimination & Toxicity

- Local Explainability: The paper leverages local explanation techniques, specifically LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), to approximate the model's behavior. LIME generates interpretable models, such as decision trees, that explain predictions for a specific instance. In this approach, the local explanation is used as the "path" in the symbolic execution, and the decisions in the decision tree are toggled to generate new constraints
